As described in the previous section, we have successfully run the existing implementation of the ABM and used it to visualize the simulation with a plot and a video. Afterwards, we identified the parts of the implementation that are relevant for our project and pushed them to our GitHub repository. While doing so, we also corrected the encountered errors as explained above and organized the code files in subfolders to make the structure of the implementation easier to understand. A more detailed description of our reduced version of the ABM implementation can be found in the README of our GitHub repository.
