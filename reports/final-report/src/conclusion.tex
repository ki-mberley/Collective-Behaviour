In this project, we have built upon the agent-based shepherding model from the paper \textit{Optimal Shepherding and Transport of a Flock} \cite{ranganathan2022optimal} and extended it by introducing a surrounding fence and additional shepherds. Additionally, we have compared our approach to the existing agent-based shepherding model from the paper \textit{Simulating Single and Multiple
Sheepdogs Guidance of a Sheep Swarm} \cite{baxter2021simulating}.

Possible next steps include a more detailed analysis of our extensions. It would be interesting to study whether the three observed shepherding behaviours driving, droving, and mustering also arise for more than one shepherd and, if so, for which sets of parameters. Furthermore, one could extend the model even further, for example by introducing obstacles along the path from the herd to the target.
