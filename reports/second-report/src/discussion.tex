% Improvements to be made for next deadline? Lots of testing writing a nice report about it

% Suggestion from the professor: implement one of the existing shepherding algorithms for multiple shepherds and compare the results to the one of our model (this seems a bit too ambitious though)

In this report, we've explained the model and the two additions we made. The basic versions of the extensions seem to be effective, and we've shared the results we obtained.

For the third and final report, we'll explore ways to improve our progress. This involves extensive testing with different parameters to ensure our extensions always work, making adjustments if necessary. For instance, our current testing involved only two shepherds beginning from the same location. However, we plan to explore the option of having a shepherd start from a different location and analyze the outcomes. We may also consider implementing the fence using forces, as the original authors intended. If our current implementation is satisfactory, we'll use the remaining time to implement an existing shepherding algorithm for multiple shepherds and compare the results to our model. This idea was suggested by the professor, and we still need to figure out how to approach it and which paper to use. Ultimately, we'll consolidate all our efforts from the past weeks into one final paper.
