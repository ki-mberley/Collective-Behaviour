\subsection{Results when introducing second shepherd}
The implementation of a second shepherd introduces an additional dog whose task is the guide the sheep towards the target. Figures \ref{fig:single-shepherd} and \ref{fig:second-shepherds} illustrate the results for trajectories with one and two shepherds. A distance penalty of 0.05 was applied. As planned, the introduction of a second shepherd is evident, and it appears to follow a trajectory similar to that of the initial shepherd but at a higher speed. Further evaluation is needed to determine whether this is always the case.

\subsection{Results when introducing a fence}
%%%% TODO: position correctly when all other text has also been added
The implementation of a fence ensures that both the dogs and sheep are surrounded by a boundary and prevents them from crossing it. In the figures below, the outcomes are depicted for the herding style 'driving' with and without a fence. As intended, the presence of the fence effectively confines the sheep and dogs within its boundaries, while the dog still leads the sheep to the target.
