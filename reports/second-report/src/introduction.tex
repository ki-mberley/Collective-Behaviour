\dropcap{I}n our initial report, we tackled the important sections of our chosen paper \textit{Optimal Shepherding
and Transport of a Flock}\cite{ranganathan2022} and mainly concentrated on explaining how to run our model.
For the second report, we build upon our previous work and will provide an overview of the current status of our project. We give a comprehensive description of our model. Additionally, we explore the implementation of two extensions to this model: a surrounding fence and the introduction of a second shepherd.
