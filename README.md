- [ ] Adapt the report such that it fits the IMRAD structure better
- [ ] Identify the essential files of the model implementation and move them to this repo
- [ ] update this GH repo

## What we plan to do
We aim to address the well-recognized issue of shepherding behavior. Our initial focus involves the reconstruction of an Agent-Based Model (ABM) approach. The existing ABM script is presently implemented in C++. Our initial challenge is to replicate this ABM model in Python (Report Deadline 1). Upon the successful recreation of the current ABM model, we will transition to an experimental phase designed to identify opportunities for further enhancements. The most promising improvements will provide valuable insights for optimizing the model or potentially developing an alternative model that may yield superior performance (Reporting Deadline 2). During the ultimate reporting deadline, we will assimilate feedback and refine our approach to ensure a polished outcome.
